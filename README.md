# Intelligence
A test to test your cognitive ability. This was a school project on Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola for the course Javascript1


The test exists of different parts, the first being word knowledge, second one a small mathematical challenge and the third one is a memory test. At the end of the test you get a result.

You can also do the test by clicking the following link: (note that the link is not updates to the latest version.  There is a bug in the memory part of the test where it does not shuffle correctly. Downloading/cloning the code from github does have this issue addressed.)
